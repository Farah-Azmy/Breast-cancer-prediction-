# Breast-cancer-prediction-
Processing data, dealing with outliers values, &amp; making GridSearchCv to get the best model.
Making a simple model for classifying breast cancer patients by some features and use(LogisticRegression,KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,GradientBoostingClassifier,SVC,MLPClassifier) 
first importing libraries (numpy,pandas,matplotlib.seaborn) and uploadig data .
And then identifying the data, describing it, finding the null values, and the relationships between the columns and some of them.
Second, cleaning the data, converting the object type to a float type, and knowing the outputliers values and dealing with them.
Finally, making models for the data and comparing them to get the best result, making a range for the data, and then identifying the best result.
